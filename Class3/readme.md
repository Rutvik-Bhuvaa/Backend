# Libuv in Node.js

Definition: Libuv is a multi-platform support library that provides asynchronous I/O capabilities to Node.js. It is written in C and designed to handle high-performance, non-blocking operations.

Role in Node.js:

1. Event Loop Management: Handles the core event loop, managing asynchronous callbacks and scheduling.

2. Asynchronous I/O: Provides non-blocking file system operations, networking, and inter-process communication.

3. Thread Pool: Utilizes a thread pool for handling expensive or blocking tasks like DNS lookup, file operations, and crypto.

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Enables Node.js to work consistently across different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

5. Timers and IPC: Manages timers, signal handling, and inter-process communication for efficient process management.
