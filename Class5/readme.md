# Monolith:

- Single codebase and tightly integrated
- Harder to scale specific parts
- Single deployment unit
- Typically uses a single technology stack
- Single point of failure
- Faster initial development but slows over time
- Easier to test initially
- Internal function calls for communication

# Microservices:

- Decentralized, loosely coupled services
- Easier to scale independently
- Independent deployment for each service
- Can use different tech stacks per service
- Fault isolation across services
- Slower to start, faster in the long run
- More complex testing
- Uses APIs or messaging (REST, gRPC) for communication
